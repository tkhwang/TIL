# GO Language

## Command option

```bash
$ go get -t 

The -t flag instructs get to also download the packages required to build
the tests for the specified packages.

The -u flag instructs get to use the network to update the named packages
and their dependencies. By default, get uses the network to check out
missing packages but does not use it to look for updates to existing packages.
```
